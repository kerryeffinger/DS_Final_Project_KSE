# DS_Final_Project_KSE

#### With news of companies laying off employees in technology positions constantly appearing in headlines, it seems as if there is a never-ending trend of tech layoffs. To investigate the characteristics of companies engaging in these layoffs and the frequency with which they occur, data was collected on these layoffs as well as some information about the company that made the decision to let these people go. The characteristics of these companies will be studied to find patterns and to create a model that will predict whether a company in the technology industry will conduct a mass layoff and how large it will be. The results and findings will be summarized visually in a dashboard that will update as the data changes. 

#### Update 2/13/23:

#### Data is collected periodocially (about once a week) from the website, layoffs.fyi. A database and corresponding table have been created using MySQL workbench, which will be updated weekly also. The SQL script to set up the database and import the data is attached in this repository in the file called database_table_setup. The most current csv file of the layoffs.fyi data is needed in order to run it. 

#### There are several csv files with the date noted on them. These are uploads of the layoffs data collected as of that date. New csv files are uploaded as often as possible, preferably once a week. 

#### The file, DS_capstone_poster, is a PDF of the poster that will be printed for the Celebration of student research in April. The poster has some blank spaces, as the rest of the information will be added once those parts of the project are completed. 

### Update 3/30/23:

### The Exploratory Data Analysis was completed. The python code is in the "Exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb" file and the Microsoft Word document detailing the conclusions with respective tables and graphs is the file titled "Exploratory_analysis_KSE.docx". 


### There is also a Tableau workbook with several visualizations titled "Capstone_KSE.twb". The dashboard summarizing the project is on the tab "Dashboard 1."
