### With news of companies laying off employees in technology positions constantly appearing in headlines, it seems as if there is a never-ending trend of tech layoffs. To investigate the characteristics of companies engaging in these layoffs and the frequency with which they occur, data was collected on these layoffs as well as some information about the company that made the decision to let these people go. The characteristics of these companies will be studied to find patterns and to create a model that will predict whether a company in the technology industry will conduct a mass layoff and how large it will be. When creating the predictive analysis, the model can be formulated with some of the data and then tested for accuracy with the rest of the data to see how well it predicts layoffs. Finally, the results and findings will be summarized visually in a dashboard that will update as the data changes.
